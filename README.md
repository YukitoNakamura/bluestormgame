Even though this is a repository, this is only for bug tracking purposes.

## Game Information
Bluestorm is a RPG Game set in a near-future world(2076):
> During a heist at a big bank corporation, the intrusion system detects invasion and promptly sounds the alarm, causing the building to go into lockdown. Unable to escape normally, you fight the guards and escape, also leaving the city. Three years later, you return and see everything changed, so you promise to unravel all secrets the city hides, alongside your long time best friends.
